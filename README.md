## üìä Platform Comparison Table

| **Blockchain Name**    | **Type**       | **Consensus Mechanism**     | **Permission Model** | **Throughput (TPS)**      | **Smart Contract Support**      | **Token Support**       | **Typical Use Case**                             | **Notable Technical Feature**           |
|------------------------|----------------|------------------------------|----------------------|----------------------------|----------------------------------|--------------------------|--------------------------------------------------|------------------------------------------|
| **Ethereum**           | Public         | Proof of Stake (PoS)         | Open                 | ~30‚Äì100 TPS (Layer 1)      | Yes ‚Äì Solidity                   | Yes ‚Äì Native (ETH)       | Decentralized applications (DeFi, NFTs, DAOs)    | EVM compatibility, large dev ecosystem  |
| **Hyperledger Fabric** | Private        | Pluggable (Raft, Kafka, etc.)| Permissioned         | ~3,000+ TPS                | Yes ‚Äì Chaincode (Go, Java, Node.js) | No native token          | Enterprise systems, private supply chains        | Modular design, private data channels   |
| **R3 Corda**           | Consortium     | Notary-based (Pluggable)     | Permissioned         | ~170 TPS (variable)        | Yes ‚Äì Kotlin / Java              | No native token          | Inter-bank settlements, regulated finance        | Point-to-point messaging, strong privacy|

## üìù Technical Comparison & Use-Case Analysis

Ethereum, Hyperledger Fabric, and R3 Corda illustrate the diversity of blockchain ecosystems. Ethereum is a fully public and decentralized platform supporting a wide range of decentralized applications through its EVM and smart contracts in Solidity. However, it has limited base-layer throughput and relies on scaling solutions for performance.

Hyperledger Fabric is a private, permissioned blockchain ideal for enterprise applications, particularly where privacy and scalability are priorities. It allows for modular configuration, identity management, and private data exchanges, making it well-suited for known-member networks like supply chains.

R3 Corda, as a consortium platform, is optimized for privacy and compliance. It facilitates direct, point-to-point communication between entities and uses pluggable notary services for consensus. Its Kotlin-based contract support and design make it ideal for complex legal and financial workflows.

### ‚úÖ Recommended Platforms by Use Case:
- **Decentralized App (dApp):** `Ethereum` ‚Äì Ideal due to openness, tokenization, and global accessibility.
- **Supply Chain Among Known Partners:** `Hyperledger Fabric` ‚Äì Suited for high throughput, identity control, and privacy.
- **Inter-bank Financial Application:** `R3 Corda` ‚Äì Designed for privacy, regulatory needs, and structured agreements.
